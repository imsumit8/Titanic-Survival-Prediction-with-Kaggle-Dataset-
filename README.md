# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-with-Kaggle-Dataset
 On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224.
 It seems some people were more likely to survive than others. We build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?”
